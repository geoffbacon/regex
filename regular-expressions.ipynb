    "## This workshop\n",

    "## Brief introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are of both theoretical and practical interest in computer science. For the theoretical side, see the [Wikipedia page on regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) and [on regular langauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language). For our purposes, a regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. We can use regular expressions to find particular patterns in text data. The text data could be an English sentence, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, Python source code, or anything you like. Once we've found a particular pattern, we can optionally replace it with some other text. **In this way, regular expressions are really just advanced \"find and replace\" techniques.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tasks you can achieve easily and quickly with regular expressions:\n",
    "- Extract all words within parentheses in a text file\n",
    "- Find all product on a webpage that costs over \\$250\n",
    "- Replace all swear words with family-friendly alternatives\n",
    "- Find every mention of a date in some text\n",
    "- Locate all the phone numbers in a series of emails\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are some situations in your work where regular expressions would be useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `(\\w+ )(\\1)`\n",
    "- `n|a|b`\n",
    "- `one`\n",
    "- `\\d+`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of regular expressions as a tiny, highly specialized programming language. This \"tiny, highly specialized programming language\" is available in Python, R, C, Excel, etc. To use regular expressions, we have to learn their syntax, just like you did when you learnt Python or R syntax. The awesome thing about regular expressions is that their syntax is almost entirely identical across different programming languages. All the patterns we wrote above match the same patterns regardless of where you're using them. In this workshop, we'll be using Python. **But bear in mind, the regular expression syntax we learn today isn't unique to Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some excellent resources on the web for learning and using regular expressions in Python. We'll refer to all of these throughout the workshop.\n",
